       <h2>COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES </h2>
       <p>By using the Site(s)/ App(s), you consent to the use of cookies in accordance with the provisions of this clause. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Site(s)/ App(s). A “Flash Cookie” is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-into or downloaded by you to your Device. Cookies and Flash Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages. If you choose to disable cookies or Flash cookies on your Device, some features of the Site(s)/ App(s) may not function properly. The use of cookies on the Site(s)/ App(s) allows you to enjoy more seamless visits and more accurately measures your behaviour on the Site(s)/ App(s). There are two types of cookies that we may use: session and persistent. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your device when you close the browser software.

They merely recognize your browser, unless you choose to identify yourself voluntarily. You may choose to identify yourself for any one of the following reasons: by asking the browser to remember your username and password, by responding to a promotional offer, or by personalizing a web page or requesting more information on a product or service.</p> 
        
       <p>Web beacons (also known as clear gifs) are used in combination with cookies to help Site(s)/ App(s) operators understand how you interact with their Site(s)/ App(s). A web beacon is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1-pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a Site(s)/ App(s) or in an email. The use of a clear gif allows the Site(s)/ App(s) to measure your actions in opening the page that contains the clear gif. </p>

       <h2>3.1 LOG FILE INFORMATION </h2>
       <p>Our servers automatically collect limited information about your device’s connection to the internet, including your IP address, Device and/or MAC ID, etc., when you visit our Site(s)/ App(s). Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send your data – such as the web pages you view.

       <p>The Adobe Flash Player (“Flash”) is an application and web tool that allows the rapid development of dynamic content. Flash (and similar applications) use technology to remember settings, preferences, and usage like browser cookies, which may be used by IICS. IICS employs Adobe Flash cookies in certain situations where we use Flash to provide some content such as video clips or animation. IICS does not use Flash cookies to serve interest-based advertising. Flash Cookies are managed through the Flash Player Settings Manager, which is a different interface than the one provided by your web browser. This Settings Manager lets you manage global Privacy Settings, Storage Settings, Security Settings, and Automatic Notification Settings. This Site(s)/ App(s) may also use Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies, text files that are stored on your Device and allows an analysis of your use of the Site(s)/ App(s). If Google Analytics is used, the information generated by the cookie about your use of the Site(s)/ App(s) (including the IP address) will be transferred to and stored on a server of Google in the US. Google will use such information to analyze your use of the Site(s)/ App(s), to create reports about the Site(s)/ App(s) activities for IICS and to provide further services associated with the use of the Site(s)/ App(s) and the internet. Furthermore, Google may transfer such information to third parties, to the extent legally required or if such third parties process the data on behalf of Google. In no event will Google associate your IP address with other information of Google. By using this Site(s)/ App(s), you consent to the processing of your information collected by Google as described above and for the purposes described above.

For example, if you are on another Site(s)/ App(s) and you opt-in to receive information from IICS that Site(s)/ App(s) will forward to us your email address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested. You may also choose to participate in a third-party application or feature on our Site(s)/ App(s) (such as linking the Site(s)/ App(s) with another Site(s)/ App(s) or interactive service) or on a third-party Site(s)/ App(s) or service (such as one of our applications or features on a third-party Site(s)/ App(s) or service) through which you allow us to collect (or the third-party to share) information about you, including Personal Information.

In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third-party Site(s)/ App(s) or service give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections” or information about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections” web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third-party Site(s)/ App(s) or interactive service.
